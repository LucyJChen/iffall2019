	<h3>Designer: Eugenia Yoh<br> Creative Director: Lucy Chen</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>consider the responsive design, and think about margin space with the large words. </li>

		<li>watch font weight of the body text. </li>

		<li>nice to have text next to the image, be consistent throughout the entire thing</li>

		<li>Text is long to read. 70 characters max per line. </li>

		<li>Responsive design for mobile, perhaps body text flows to bottom, but keep it next to the image in desktop view. </li>

		<li>Don’t need secondary box line. Don’t need to be boxes behind it. </li>

		<li>small row of images in gallery (doesn’t need to be interactive, good to provide context). </li>

		<li>Labels aren’t necessary for the gallery but could be nice. Small caption. Grid. 3X3</li>
	</ul>
