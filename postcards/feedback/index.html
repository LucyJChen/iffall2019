	<h2>Feedback for Charlotte Milbauer</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The font you've chosen is really good and fits with the theme of the Incredibles.</li>
		<li>I think you could experiment more with image manipulation or type styling to make the text stand out from the background.</li>
		<li>The text could be placed closer to each character's mouth or the focal point of each image.</li>
		<li>The cropping of each image as it goes to mobile view is well done and still shows the focal point of each image.</li>
		<li>There are quotations missing from the Frozone mobile view.</li>
		<li>Images are a little pixelated at least on my screen.</li>
	</ul>
