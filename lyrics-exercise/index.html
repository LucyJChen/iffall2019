				<p>Come in close now, it's time to tell a story<br>
				Long ago and so many years before we<br>
				Ever were, ever dreamed we even could be<br>
				There was her and her very first heartbeat
				</p>
				<p>
				All alone in the corner of the night sky<br>
				Spiral bones of a supernova starlight<br>
				Fell in love with another burning bright she<br>
				Dreamed of a way to ignite she said,
				</p>
				<p>
				Tonight<br>
				Come on, come on collide<br>
				Break me to pieces, I<br>
				I think you're just like heaven why<br><br>
				Come on, come on collide<br>
				Let's see what a fire feels like<br>
				I bet it's just like heaven<br><br>
				Just like heaven<br>
				Just like heaven <br><br><br>
				</p>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<ol>
				<p>Such a shame<br>
				nowhere near, even the near mist light years away<br>
				From the hope of being sun-kissed anchored home<br>
				in her interstellar sea but, poor lonely Cassiopeia<br>
				So she sighs and she burns with desperation<br>
				Learns to cry over love of constellations<br>
				Then the spark from a star shooting too close<br>
				They both smiled what a day to explode, she said
				</p>
				<p>Tonight<br>
				Come on, come on collide<br>
				Break me to pieces, I<br>
				I think you're just like heaven why<br><br>
				Come on, come on collide<br>
				Let's see what a fire feels like<br>
				I bet it's just like heaven<br><br>
				Just like heaven<br>
				Just like heaven
				</p>
				<p>
				Long ago in a sky built before us<br>
				A supernova grew up to be stardust
				</p>
