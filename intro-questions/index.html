		<li>I needed to take this class but I also have interest in web design and AR technology.</li>
		<li>I know Java but it has been a while since I've use it</li>
		<li>I hope to learn how to create a full website in html!</li>
		<li>User interactions with objects on the screen like buttons/links and hover animations etc.</li>
		<li>https://public-library.org/ I think this website is well designed because it makes use of an effective grid system with rollover animation and a clean hierarchy. It takes away unnesscesary information until you roll over it.</li>
		<li>https://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times site effectively communicates lots of information well. They use a very effective and clear hierarchy and seperate stories with strokes and negative space. They have the most important information at the top of their page and then you can search through and explore for more. They also make use of pictures effectively to add hierarchy to different stories.</li>
		<li>https://www.alvinailey.org/ I think this website works well because it entices the viewer with large scale video and bold type but is also very easily navigatable. It also has a home page with both a drop down menu or one can scroll down the page for more information./li>
